      in Bardic Lore, a special lore skill that can be used only to Recall Knowledge, but can
      be used to Recall Knowledge on any topic. If you are legendary in Occultism, you
      become an expert in Bardic Lore, but you can’t increase your proficiency rank in
      Bardic Lore by any other means.`,

      cast at a cost of 1 Spell Point. Increase your Spell Point pool by 2.`,
      'Versatile Performance': `In social situations, you can rely on the grandeur of your performances
      rather than ordinary social skills. You can use Performance instead of Diplomacy to
      Make an Impression and instead of Intimidation to Demoralize. You can also use an
      acting performance instead of Deception to Impersonate.`,

        by paying the appropriate cost and using your Occultism skill, similarly to how a wizard
        can Learn Arcane Spells and add those spells to his spellbook.
        During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your spellbook. If the spell
        you choose is already in your spell repertoire, you can heighten it with spontaneous
        heightening that day. If it isn’t in your repertoire, treat it as though it were in it for that day.`,

        aids your allies’ skill checks.`,

        remember something. You learn the loremaster’s recall power (see page 236), which you can
