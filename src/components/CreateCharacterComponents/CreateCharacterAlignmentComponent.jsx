            doesn&apos;t feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good
            vs. evil or law vs. chaos (and thus neutral is sometimes called

            conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality.

            Neutral means you act naturally in any situation, without
            prejudice or compulsion.

            resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. <br />
