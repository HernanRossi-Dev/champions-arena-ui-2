          <p>
            The strength of the fist flows from the power of mind and spirit. You seek
            to attain perfection—to hone your body into a flawless instrument and
            your mind into an orderly bastion of wisdom. You are a fierce combatant
            renowned for your martial arts skills and your ability to enter stances
            to achieve different outcomes during a fight. While the challenges of
            mastering fighting styles and conquering powerful foes drive you to
            greater and greater heights, you also enjoy meditating on philosophical
            questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment.

            You are an eternal student of the arcane secrets of the universe. You
            treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical
            spellcraft with ancient tomes of lost magic to discover and understand
            how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and there’s no way you can
            study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic,
            gaining deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all
            others, or favor a broader approach emphasizing the way all magic
            comes together at the expense of depth.

            You didn’t choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There’s

            forebear communed with a primal creature, or a powerful occult ritual
            has influenced your line. Regardless, self-reflection and study allow you
            to refine your inherent magical skills and continuously unlock new
            and more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk,
            however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you’ll rise to
            become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.

            rogues make respectable and honorable livings as bounty hunters,
            detectives, or scouts, and even sometimes as aristocrats, diplomats, or
            politicians. One thing you all share in common is the breadth and
            depth of your training in skills, easily outpacing your more martially or
            magically inclined comrades.

          <p>
            For some rangers, civilization is so corrupt it wears down the soul, yet so
            beneficial it needs protecting from wild things that stalk the hinterlands.
            For others, nature needs to be protected from the greedy hands of
            civilized people wishing to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures.
            You could champion either goal, or straddle the line of both. You might
            be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge
            of civilization or exploring the wilds. Living off the land, you are skilled
            at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.

          <h3>Bard</h3>
          <p>
          You are a master of artistry, a scholar of hidden secrets, and a
          captivating persuader. Using powerful performances, you influence
          minds and elevate souls to new levels of heroics. You might use your
          powers to become a charismatic leader, or perhaps a counselor,
          manipulator, scholar, scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility
          allows some to consider you a jack-of-all-trades and a beguiling ne’er-
          do-well who spends too much time in taverns, it’s dangerous to dismiss
          you as a master of none.

          <h3>Barbarian</h3>
          <p>
          Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in carving through your enemies
          using powerful weapons and wreaking havoc, relying on astonishing
          durability, without needing complicated techniques or rigid training.
          You associate your rage with a traditional symbol of affinity known
          as a totem, which might take the form of an animal, a spirit, or a part
          of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every
          problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the dark
          emotions inside them and release them only when it matters most.
